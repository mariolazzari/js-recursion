# JavaScript Recursion

Recursion occurs when functions call themselves to perform a task.
It is a **problem-solving technique** where solution of a larger problem is defined in terms of smaller instances of itself.

- There must be a based case for all accurate inputs
- There must be a based case that does not recursive calls
- Recursive calls should make forward progress to base case
