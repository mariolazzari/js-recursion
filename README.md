# JavaScript Recursion

Recursion occurs when functions call themselves to perform a task.
It is a **problem-solving technique** where solution of a larger problem is defined in terms of smaller instances of itself.

- There must be a based case for all accurate inputs
- There must be a based case that does not recursive calls
- Recursive calls should make forward progress to base case

## Head recursion

Recursive calls happen before processing

## Tail recursion

Recursive calls happen after processing

- More efficient
- No stack overflow
- Progress monitoring

## Wrapper function

Function that helps main function

## Accumulators

## Memoization

## Quicksort

- Worst  : O(n^2)
- Average: O(nlogn) 

### Phases

- swapping
- partitioning
- sorting
